# Telegram Bot

- `custom.telegram-bot` connects Muse to the Telegram Bot API at `api.telegram.org`. It authenticates with the registered `api_key` credential, which is the bot token you created with BotFather for your own bot.

- Helpers live in `~/workspace/custom-connectors/custom.telegram-bot/bin/`. The helper `tg.py` offers get-me, get-updates, send-message, send-photo, get-chat, chat-action, react, set-webhook, get-webhook-info and delete-webhook. `send-message` sends a typing chat action just before the message by default (use `--no-typing` to skip it); `send-photo --chat-id <id> --photo <file> [--caption ...]` sends an upload_photo chat action first, then uploads the local file. `chat-action --chat-id <id> --action typing` sends a chat action on its own. `react --chat-id <id> --message-id <n> [--emoji 👀]` adds an emoji reaction (default 👀, used as a read receipt). The example relay scripts (`examples/fetch.py` / `examples/watch.py`) automatically react 👀 on each fresh relevant message they pull, and start a detached `typing_keeper.py` that keeps a typing indicator visible until the message is marked handled (private chats always; in groups only when the owner writes or the bot is named).

## Connect

- The connection was registered with `credentials.request_api_access` and these details. Reuse them to reconnect:

```json
{
  "provider": "telegram-bot",
  "auth_scheme": "api_key",
  "placement": "url_path_segment:/bot{}",
  "api_hosts": ["api.telegram.org"]
}
```

- Before the first change in a conversation, prove access with a harmless read:

```text
python3 ~/workspace/custom-connectors/custom.telegram-bot/bin/tg.py get-me
```

## Credentials

- The registered connection holds the credential. Helpers import `/opt/muse/skills/custom-connector-setup/bin/dynamic_credentials.py`, which returns an `hsurr:` surrogate and places it where the provider reads the key. Muse swaps in the real credential only on an approved request to a registered host.

- Never put a key, token, password or cookie in this doc, a helper, a command argument, an environment variable or a log. Never ask the user to paste one in chat.

- Keep redirects disabled on authenticated requests.

- On a 401 or 403, check the request first. Confirm that the helper attached the credential, that the host is registered and that the placement and scopes match.

- Only when a request that carried the credential is still rejected, call `credentials.request_api_access` with the details above and `"reconnect": true`.

## Build the request URL

- Build Bot API URLs by concatenating the raw surrogate after `bot`, exactly as `tg.py` does through `dynamic_credential_entry`. The runtime swap matches the surrogate literally, so it must reach the request byte for byte: never percent-encode it. Do not use `url_with_surrogate_path_segment` for this connector, because it percent-encodes the colon inside the surrogate and the swap then cannot find the surrogate, which makes Telegram answer 404.

- Never print a request URL, because it carries the surrogate.

## Verify the bot identity

- Read the bot account behind the stored token. This call changes nothing.

```text
python3 ~/workspace/custom-connectors/custom.telegram-bot/bin/tg.py get-me
```

- Read `result.username`, `result.id`, `result.can_join_groups` and `result.can_read_all_group_messages` from the JSON output. `can_read_all_group_messages` is true only when group privacy mode is off for the bot (BotFather `/setprivacy`, or make the bot a group admin).

## Fetch new messages

- Read the updates Telegram buffered for the bot. getUpdates with an offset confirms all earlier updates, so advance the offset only after the updates are safely stored. The example scripts `examples/fetch.py` / `examples/watch.py` in the repository own that state and print a NONE, RELEVANT or ERROR digest.

```text
python3 ~/workspace/telegram-relay/fetch.py
```

- The scripts append compact records to `~/workspace/telegram-relay/queue.jsonl`, persist the offset in `~/workspace/telegram-relay/state.json`, and run only inside agent turns, because hooks and system services have no connector credentials in this runtime. The bot's own username, id and name keywords come from a `local.json` in the relay directory (see `examples/fetch.py`); that file is local-only and never committed.

## Send a message

- Send a text message as the bot to a chat the bot belongs to. This changes state, so only send when the user asked for it or when a watch task's rules apply.

```text
python3 ~/workspace/custom-connectors/custom.telegram-bot/bin/tg.py send-message --chat-id <chat_id> --text "<text>"
```

- Add `--reply-to <message_id>` to reply to one message, and `--thread-id <message_thread_id>` for a forum topic inside a supergroup. Read the new `result.message_id` from the JSON output.

## Read a chat

- Read basic information about a chat by id or username. This call changes nothing.

```text
python3 ~/workspace/custom-connectors/custom.telegram-bot/bin/tg.py get-chat --chat-id <chat_id>
```

## Recover from errors

- Telegram answers 404 when the token in the path is not in the `<bot id>:<secret>` format at all. Check the URL construction and the surrogate handling first, because a percent-encoded or missing surrogate produces exactly this answer even when the stored token is correct.

- Telegram answers 401 when the token format is right but the token is wrong or revoked. Ask the user to confirm the current token in BotFather under API Token, then reconnect.

- After a failed or timed-out change, check the current state with a read before trying again, because the first request may have completed.

## Limits

- The bot sees group messages only when group privacy mode is off for this bot. It cannot read chats it has not joined, and Telegram keeps unconfirmed updates for about 24 hours.

- The watch runs as an agent cron firing every 10 minutes in a supervisor-plus-watcher pattern: each run checks the watcher heartbeat (`~/workspace/telegram-relay/watcher-state.json`) and either exits at once (watcher healthy), takes over (watcher old or dead), or revives it. A watcher serves a term of about 60 minutes looping `~/workspace/telegram-relay/watch.py --slice 600`, which long-polls getUpdates (50s server-side waits) under a file lock, queues messages exactly like fetch.py, and returns the same NONE / RELEVANT / ERROR digest plus LOCKED when another watch slice is already fetching. Handover is seamless: a starting slice passes `--wait-lock 1800` to queue on the lock until the previous watcher yields, instead of standing down. A killed watcher is detected by its stale heartbeat and replaced within about 10 minutes; Telegram buffers updates for about 24 hours, so interruptions delay but never lose messages. Reactions and replies are still minutes late at best, never guaranteed instant, because an agent turn must judge each message. Hooks and systemd services were both ruled out for polling, because hooks have no connector credentials and services do not inherit the tool environment or approvals.
